# Introduction to MongoDB

## What is it?
- A document database, which we can use to store and retrieve complex data from.
- Very commonly used with Node and Express (MEAN & MERN stacks).
- Plays particularly well with JavaScript.
### Document-Oriented Database / Document Data Store
- A type/category of NoSQL database.
- Store information in some format (ex: JSON) to a document.
- Take data as it is and store all of its relevant information in a single instance in the database, without having to store them in a table that follows a pre-defined schema.

## Types of Databases
### SQL Databases
- Structured Query Language databases are relational databases.
- We pre-define a schema of tables before we insert anything.
- Everything is done in table and has to conform to a pattern.
- Ex: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.
### NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL databases do not use SQL. 
- There are many types of no-sql databases, including document, key-value, and graph stores.
- Ex: MongoDB, Couch DB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis.
