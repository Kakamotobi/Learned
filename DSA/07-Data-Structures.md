## What are Data Structures?
- **Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.**
  - Ex: array holds many values, values are ordered, and arrays come with all sorts of methods and functionalities.
- *Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (ex: array, JS object) are more generally used.*
  - Ex: use graphs for map/location data.
  - Ex: use linked list for an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end.
  - Ex: use trees for web scraping nested HTML.
  - Ex: use binary heaps for a scheduler.
  - Less common data structures are not built-in. So, will have to be implemented manually.
