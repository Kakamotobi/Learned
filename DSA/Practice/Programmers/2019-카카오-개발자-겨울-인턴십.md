## [크레인 인형뽑기 게임](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/64061)
- **Inputs**
  - A 2D array `board` representing a square board.
    - `board[i]` represents a row of the game board (starting from the most top row).
    - `board[i][j]` represents a doll in that slot.
  - An array of positive integers `moves` representing the "column" of the board in which the crane picked a doll.
- **Description**
  - Every time the crane picks a doll, the doll is removed from the board and stacked in a separate pile.
  - If the same two dolls are stacked consecutively, they both "pop" from the pile.
- **Output:** return the number of dolls that have been "popped" from the pile.
- **Constraints**
  - `0 <= board[i][j] <= 100`.
    - A doll is represented as a a number from 1 to 100.
    - 0 means that there is no doll in that slot.
  - `1 <= moves.length <= 1000`.
  - `1 <= moves[i] <= board.length`.
    - `moves[i]` is guaranteed to be a valid column in the board.
### Example
```js
solution([[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,3],[0,2,5,0,1],[4,2,4,4,2],[3,5,1,3,1]], [1,5,3,5,1,2,1,4]); // 4

  // Board Before              Board After
  // [[0,0,0,0,0],             [[0,0,0,0,0],
  //  [0,0,1,0,3],              [0,0,0,0,0],
  //  [0,2,5,0,1],      =>      [0,0,5,0,0],
  //  [4,2,4,4,2],              [0,2,4,0,2],
  //  [3,5,1,3,1]]              [0,5,1,3,1]]
```
### Solution
- **TC: O(m\*b)**
  - m: the number of moves made by the crane (`moves.length`).
  - b: the number of rows in board (i.e. `board.length` since it is a square board).
```js
const solution = (board, moves) => {
  const basket = [];
  let count = 0;
  
  for (let move of moves) {
    for (let row of board) {
      if (row[move-1] > 0) {
        if (row[move-1] === basket[basket.length-1]) {
          basket.pop();
          count += 2;
        } else {
          basket.push(row[move-1]);
        }
        row[move-1] = 0;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return count;
}
```
