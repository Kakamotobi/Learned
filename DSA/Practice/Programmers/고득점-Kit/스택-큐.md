- **Inputs**
  - An array of natural numbers `progresses` representing the order of deployment for features.
    - `progresses[i]` represents the current progress of a feature.
  - An array of natural numbers `speeds` representing the speed of development (per day) for each feature, in the same order as `progresses`.
- **Description**
  - Preceding features need to be completed first before being deployed.
  - Ex: `[a,b,c]` even if task `c` is completed, tasks `a` and `b` have to be completed before it can get deployed.
- **Output:** in an array, return the number of features that is deployed per deployment.
- **Constraints**
  - `progresses.length <= 100`.
  - `speeds.length <= 100`.
  - `1 < progresses[i] < 100`.
  - `1 < speeds[i] <= 100`.
  - Only one deployment is allowed per day, at the end of the day.
### Example
```js
solution([93,30,55], [1,30,5]); // [2,1]
solution([95,90,99,99,80,99], [1,1,1,1,1,1]); // [1,3,2]
solution([95,95,95,95], [4,3,2,1]); // [2,1,1]
```
### Solution
- Loop through the queue `progresses`.
  - Calculate the number of days required for the current feature to complete.
  - Apply the days of progress to all features.
  - Find out how many features are completed and record it.
  - Move on to the next incomplete feature.
```js
const solution = (progresses, speeds) => {
  const answer = [];
  
  let i = 0;
  while (i < progresses.length) {
    const numDaysTo100 = Math.ceil((100 - progresses[i]) / speed[i]);
    
    for (let j = i; j < progresses.length; j++) {
      const progressMadeToday = progresses[j] + (speeds[j] * numDaysTo100);
      progresses[j] = progressMadeToday >= 100 ? 100 : progressMadeToday;
    }
    
    let temp = i;
    while (progresses[temp] === 100) temp++;
    answer.push(temp - i);
    i = temp;
  }
  
  return answer;
}
```
