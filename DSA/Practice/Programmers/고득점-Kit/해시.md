## [완주하지 못한 선수](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/42576)
- **Inputs**
  - An array of strings `participant` representing all participants of the marathon.
  - An array of strings `completion` representing the participants that completed the marathon.
- **Description**
  - Everyone completed the marathon except for one person.
- **Output:** return the name of the person that did not complete the marathon.
- **Constraints**
  - `1 <= participant.length <= 100,000`.
    - `1 <= participant[i].length <= 20`.
  - `completion.length === participant.length - 1`.
  - There can be participants that share the same name.
### Example
```js
solution(["leo","kiki","eden"], ["eden","kiki"]); // "leo"
solution(["marina","josipa","nikola","vinko","filipa"], ["josipa","filipa","marina","nikola"]); // "vinko"
solution(["mislav","stanko","mislav","ana"], ["stanko","ana","mislav"]); // "mislav"
```
### Solutions
#### Solution 1 - O(n)
- Use a hash table to store the number of times each name appear.
- Remove those that have completed the marathon.
- There should be only one person left in the hash table.
```js
const solution = (participant, completion) => {
  const obj = {};
  
  for (let p of participant) {
    obj[p] = ++obj[p] || 1;
  }
  
  for (let c of completion) {
    obj[c]--;
    if (obj[c] === 0) delete obj[c]; // To prevent iterations when finding the target.
  }
  
  // The only property left in obj is the person who did not complete the marathon.
  return Object.keys(obj)[0];
}
```
#### Solution 2 - O(n log n)
- Sort both arrays.
- Iterate through both arrays at the same time.
  - Return `participant[i]` when they are different.

## [전화번호 목록](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/42577)
- **Input:** an array of strings `phone_book` representing phone numbers.
- **Output:** return false if a phone number is a prefix of another phone number. Otherwise, return true.
- **Constraints**
  - `1 <= phone_book.length <= 1,000,000`.
  - `1<= phone_book[i] <= 20`.
  - There are no duplicate numbers.
### Example
```js
solution(["119", "97674223", "1195524421"]); // false
solution(["123","456","789"]); // true
solution(["12","123","1235","567","88"]); // false
```
### Solution
- Sort the phone numbers in increasing order (so that similar phone numbers, if any, are adjacent of one another).
- Compare this phone number with the next phone number.
```js
const solution = (phone_book) => {
  phone_book.sort();

  for (let i = 0; i < phone_book.length - 1; i++) {
    if (phone_book[i+1].startsWith(phone_book[i])) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

## [위장](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/42578)
- **Input:** an array of arrays `clothes` where `clothes[i]` represents each clothing.
  - `clothes[i][0]` represents the name of the clothing.
  - `clothes[i][1]` represents the type of clothing.
- **Description**
  - Clothes of the same type cannot be worn at the same time.
  - You have to wear different combinations everyday.
  - At least one clothing has to be worn.
- **Output:** return the number of combinations that could be made using the given clothes.
- **Constraints**
  - `clothes[i]` is always represented as `[name, type]`.
  - `1 <= clothes.length <= 30`.
  - Clothes do not share the same name.
  - All strings:
    - have a length between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
    - consist of only lowercase alphabets and/or "_".
  - Need to wear at least one clothing.
### Example
```js
solution([["yellowhat", "headgear"], ["bluesunglasses", "eyewear"], ["green_turban", "headgear"]]); // 5
solution([["crowmask", "face"], ["bluesunglasses", "face"], ["smoky_makeup", "face"]]); // 3
```
### Solution
- Record the number of clothes for each type.
- Get the number of combinations by multiplying (number of clothes per type + 1) of each type. Then subtract 1 from that value.
```js
const solution = (clothes) => {
  let combinations = 1;
  const numClothesPerType = {};
  
  for (let [name, type] of clothes) {
    numClothesPerType[type] = ++numClothesPerType[type] || 1;
  }
  
  for (let numClothes of Object.values(numClothesPerType)) {
    combinations *= (numClothes + 1);
  }
  
  return combinations - 1;
}
```

## [베스트앨범](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/42579)
- **Inputs**
  - An array of strings `genres` representing the genre of each song.
  - An array of positive integers `plays` representing the number of times that the song has been played.
- **Description**
  - The objective is to collect two of the most played songs in each genre to create a "best album".
  - Each song is identified with a serial number (the index).
  - Rules to add to the album:
    - The genre with the number of most plays should come first.
    - The song with the most plays should come first for each genre.
      - If the songs have been played the same number of times, the song with the lower serial number should come first.
- **Output:** return the serial numbers of the songs in order to be included in the "best album".
- **Constraints**
  - `genres[i]` represents the genre of the song with the serial number `i`.
  - `plays[i]` represents the the number of plays of the song with the serial number `i`.
  - `1<= number of songs <= 10,000`.
    - `genres.length === plays.length`.
    - If there is only one song in the genre, only select that song.
  - `number of genres < 100`.
  - All genres have a different number of plays.
### Example
```js
solution(["classic","pop","classic","classic","pop"],[500,600,150,800,2500]); // [4,1,3,0]
```
### Solution
- Find out the order of genres to be included in the best album.
- Organize all songs into their respective genres.
  - Ex: `{ serialNum: numPlays }`.
- Using the two, collect the serial numbers of the songs to be included in the best album.
```js
const solution = (genres, plays) => {
  const bestAlbum = [];
  const totalPlaysPerGenre = {};
  const songsPerGenre = {};
  
  for (let i = 0; i < genres.length; i++) {
    // Calculate total plays for each genre.
    if (totalPlaysPerGenre[genres[i]]) totalPlaysPerGenre[genres[i]] += plays[i];
    else totalPlaysPerGenre[genres[i]] = plays[i];
    
    // Organize songs into their respective genre.
    if (songsPerGenre[genres[i]]) songsPerGenre[genres[i]].push({[i]: plays[i]});
    else songsPerGenre[genres[i]] = [{[i]: plays[i]}];
  }
  
  // Sort genres in order of most plays.
  const genresInOrder = Object.keys(totalPlaysPerGenre).sort((a, b) => {
    return totalPlaysPerGenre[b] - totalPlaysPerGenre[a];
  });
  
  // Sort songs in order of most plays in each genre.
  for (let songs of Object.values(songsPerGenre)) {
    songs.sort((a, b) => {
      return Object.values(b)[0] - Object.values(a)[0];
    });
  }
  
  const bestAlbum = [];
  
  // Collect the two most played songs in each genre.
  for (let genre in genresInOrder) {
    const bestSongs = songsPerGenre[genre].slice(0, 2);
    for (let bestSong of bestSongs) {
      bestAlbum.push(parseInt(Object.keys(bestSong)[0]));
    }
  }
  
  return bestAlbum;
}
```
