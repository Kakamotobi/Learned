- **Input:** an array of positive integers `answers` representing the answers to an exam.
- **Description**
  - There are 3 students.
  - Student1 picks the answers as such: 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,...
  - Student2 picks the answers as such: 2,1,2,3,2,4,2,5,2,1,2,3,2,4,2,5,...
  - Student3 picks the answers as such: 3,3,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,3,3,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,...
- **Output:** return the student(s) with the highest number of correct answers in an array.
- **Constraints**
  - `answers.length <= 10,000`.
  - `1 <= answers[i] <= 5`.
  - If more than one student share the highest number of correct answer, return them in ascending order.
### Example
```js
solution([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1]
solution([1,3,2,4,2]); // [1,2,3]
```
### Solution
```js
const solution = (answers) => {
  const highestScorers = [];

  const student1Picks = [1,2,3,4,5];
  const student2Picks = [2,1,2,3,2,4,2,5];
  const student3Picks = [3,3,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5];
  
  const scores = [0,0,0]; // student1, student2, student3
  
  for (let i = 0; i < answers.length; i++) {
    if (student1Picks[i % student1Picks.length] === answers[i]) scores[0]++;
    if (student2Picks[i % student2Picks.length] === answers[i]) scores[1]++;
    if (student3Picks[i % student3Picks.length] === answers[i]) scores[2]++;
  }
  
  const maxScore = Math.max(...scores);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    if (scores[i] === maxScore) highestScorers.push(i+1);
  }
  
  return highestScorers;
}
```
