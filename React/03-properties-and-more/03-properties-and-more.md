# Properties and More

## Properties
- A useful component is a reusable one, which often means making it configurable or customizable.
- Way of passing data from one component to another (from a parent to a child).
### Using Properties
- Go to wherever you're calling upon a component and pass data inside the component tag (just like passing in a `src` attribute for an image).
- `console.log(this.props` to see props object.
