## What is Context API
> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

> Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by *many* components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.
- Context can be used in combination with hooks (useContext, useReducer) to create a centralized data store (Context) where all of the state for the entire application is managed - just like Redux.
