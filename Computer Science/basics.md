# Basics

## HTTP vs HTTPS
### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Allows for the communication between different systems (most commonly used to transfer data from a web server to a browser to allow users to view web pages).
- Information that flows from server to browser is not encrypted, which means it can easily be stolen.
### Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
- Uses a **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate** to create a secure encrypted connection between the server and the browser, thereby protecting potentially sensitive information from being stolen as it is transferred between the server and the browser.
- Crucial especially for websites requiring sensitive data (ex: credit card info, password).
- Can also boost SEO efforts.
- It is required for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).
  - AMP: a way to load content onto mobile devices at a much faster rate.
