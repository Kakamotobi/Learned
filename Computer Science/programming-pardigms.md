## What are Programming Paradigms?
- A style or a "way" of programming.
- Approaches to solve problems using some programming language.
- There are lots of programming languages but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.
- Some features that determine a programming paradigm are:
  - Modularity, objects, interrupts or events, control flow, etc.

## Declarative vs Imperative Programming
### Declarative Programming
- A type of programming paradigm that describes what programs to be executed.
- Concerned with the answer that is received more than the process.
- Focuses on end result.
- i.e. "*What* is to be done."
- Ex: functional programming, logic programming.
### Imperative Programming
- A type of programming paradigm that describes how the program executes.
- Concerned with how to get an answer step by step.
- The order of execution is very important.
- i.e. "*How* it is to be done."
- Ex: object-oriented programming, procedural programming.

## Functional Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming
### Functional Programming (FP)
> A programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.
- **Emphasizes on the use of functions where each function performs a specific task.**
- Avoid shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
- Data in the functions are immutable.
  - Outputs of a function are purely based on the arguments. So, given the same inputs, the output will always be the same.
- Cannot hide data.
- Fundamental elements: variables and functions.
- It is a *declarative* type of programming style.
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
> A programming paradigm that relies on the concept of **classes** and **objects**.
- **Structures a program into simple, reusable pieces of code (usually classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.**
- Objects are used to represent things.
- Data used are mutable data.
  - Data (held as attributes in objects) are manipulated using methods given to the object.
- Can hide data through encapsulation.
- Fundamental elements: objects and methods.
- It is an *imperative* type of programming style.
