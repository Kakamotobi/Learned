## Resolution
- Every display is made up of pixels, and the number of pixels it has contributes to the quality of the display (along with other factors such as color accuracy, contrast, brightness, refresh rates, response time).
- A display with a higher number of pixels can provide more detailed and refined images.
### Display and Image Resolution
- An image's resolution is measured in Pixels Per Inch(PPI).
- An image with a higher resolution than the display may appear smaller than its actual size to fit the display.
  - The display is not able to show all of the image's information, therefore, when enlarged to its size, some detail and clarity may be lost, causing the image to look blurry or pixelated.
- An image with a lower resolution than the display may be blurry or pixelated as well.
### Common Display Resolutions
| Resolution          | No. of Pixels |
|---------------------|---------------|
| 1280 x 720 (720p)   | 921,600       |
| 1920 x 1080 (1080p) | 2,076,300     |
| 2560 x 1440 (2K)    | 3,686,400     |
| 3840 x 2160 (4K)    | 8,294,400     |
| 5120 x 2880 (5K)    | 14,745,600    |
| 7680 x 4320 (8K)    | 33,177,600    |
| 10240 x 4320 (10K)  | 44,236,800    |

## Refresh Rate
- The Refresh Rate of a display refers to the number of times per second that the display updates.
  - Ex: 60Hz means the display updates its image 60 times per second.
- A higher refresh rate results in a more smooth and responsive display.
- _Note: the graphics card/hardware that is driving the display must also output a high enough frame rate as the display's refresh rate in order to really use the display's high refresh rate._
