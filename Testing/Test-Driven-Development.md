## What is Test-Driven Development(TDD)
> Test-driven development (TDD), which is rooted in extreme programming, is all about satisfying your team that the code works as expected for a behavior or use case. Instead of aiming for the optimum solution in the first pass, the code and tests are iteratively built together one use case at a time. Development teams use TDD as part of many coding disciplines to ensure test coverage, improve code quality, set the groundwork for their delivery pipeline, and support continuous delivery. | IBM

> The basic concept of TDD is that all production code is written in response to a test case. | IBM

- Write unit test code &rarr; Write code &rarr; Fail/Pass --> Refactoring

## Behavior-Driven Development(BDD)
- Similar to TDD but instead of by units of functions, testing is done by units of interactions/scenarios.
