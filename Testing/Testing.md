## Goals of Testing
- Help sustain and maintain software, making it feasible to immediately update a section.
- Automate the process of ensuring that our app works as we expect.
- Keep us from having to manually click around the app to find bugs.
- Make sure the app still works as expected even after we change something.
- Help detect flaws in code earlier on.
### Opinion
- There are many testing frameworks/libraries out there that people spend more time setting it up than they do writing tests.
- All testing frameworks/libraries are essentially the same.
- We don't even have to use a testing library.

## Types of Tests
### Unit Test
- Testing by small units of the application.
  - A unit could be a funciton, class, invidiaul program, etc.
- [More here](https://github.com/Kakamotobi/Learned/blob/main/Testing/Basics-of-Unit-Testing.md).
### Integration Test
- Testing multiple units together as a combined entity.
- The aim is to find any interface defects between modules/functions.
### System Test
- Testing the whole system.
### Acceptance Test
- Testing to see the degree to which the application meet the end user's approval.
### UI Test
- Testing to see if the UI meets the specifications.
### End-to-End Test
- Testing the application flow from start to finish.
- Sometimes also refers to UI Testing.
