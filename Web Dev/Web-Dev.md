# Web Development

## Static Web Page vs. Dynamic Web Page
### Static Web Page
- Web pages that are fixed and display the same content for every user (ex: HTML and CSS).
- Static websites usually come with a fixed number of web pages that have a specific layout.
- The page's source code won't change.
- Informational.
### Dynamic Web Page
- Web page that displays different content and provide user interaction (use advanced programming and databases in addition to HTML).
- *Content of the web page is generated and displayed based on what actions the users make on the page.*
- When a user accesses a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and/or on the server.
  - The end result is the same as that on a static website: an HTML page displayed on the browser.
- Combination of client-side and server-side scripting.
#### Client-side Scripting
- Code that is executed by the browser (JS).
#### Server-side Scripting
- Code that is executed by the server (before the content is sent to the user's browser).
- Makes the HTML and CSS functional.
