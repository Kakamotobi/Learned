- **Web Server**
  - A Web Server is responsible for delivering static compressed web content (Ex: HTML, CSS, images, videos, files, cache, etc.).
  - When requesting for these resources, the request ends here.
  - Ex: Apache, Nginx.
- **Web Application Server(WAS)**
  - A WAS is responsible for providing interaction between clients and server-side application code (Ex: business logic, DB read/write).
  - Ex: Apache Tomcat, Oracle WebLogic.
